Hi Mallya,

Please find the folder link for sample data. I have added data for:
1) fc_exec_summ_part_Ivl_tableau, which supports forecasting executive summary and part-level detail data.
2) inv_exec_summ_tableau, which supports the Inventory Executive Summary Tableau dashboard.
3) inv_plan_exception_tableau table.
4) inv_validation_tableau table, which supports Target Validation Dashboard.

Additionally, there are two more tables: inv_part_Ivl_tableau and fc_model_comparison_tableau. We are currently experiencing delays in downloading from S3. Once the files are downloaded locally, we will add them to the same team folder.
